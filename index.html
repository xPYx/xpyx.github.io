	<h1>You can learn anything!</h1>


	<h4>Hi! I'm Ville!</h4>
	<p>
		Nowadays I get the biggest kicks out of learning new things! Be it a new framework or a programming language,
		new deep learning magic from some data scientist's bag of tricks or a new hack I stumble upon in my Twitter feed.
		<br><br>

		This webpage is a public diary and a notebook for my projects.
		<br><br>
		For now, I just want to help like-minded people find cool stories, hacks and projects trough this website.
		<br><br>
		Welcome.
