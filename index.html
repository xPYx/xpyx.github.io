	<h1>Be curious</h1>
	<p>
		Nowadays I get the biggest kicks out of learning new tricks! Be it a new framework or a programming language,
		a new deep learning tip from a blog from 6000 km away or a new hack I read about...

		I've learnt to learn again and I'm insatiable about it.

		This is my public diary or a notebook for my projects. Let's see what it becomes after a few years.

		For now, I just want to help like-minded people find cool stories and hacks and projects trough this website.

		Welcome.</p>
