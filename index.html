	<h1>Be curious</h1>
	<p>
		Nowadays I get the biggest kicks out of learning new tricks! Be it a new framework or a programming language,
		a new deep learning technique from a data scientist's blog or a new hack I read about from
		<a href="https://www.darkreading.com" _target="blank">Dark Reading</a>.
		<br><br>
		I've learnt to learn again and I'm insatiable about it.
		<br><br>
		This is my public diary or a notebook for my projects. Let's see what it becomes after a few years.
		<br><br>
		For now, I just want to help like-minded people find cool stories and hacks and projects trough this website.
		<br><br>
		Welcome.</p>
