Let's begin.

The first post is going to be about the configuration of my site, www.xpyx.fi.

The webhosting is from [Suomen Hostingpalvelu Oy](https://www.hostingpalvelu.fi/) and I used
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to build it. I use [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to author my posts.

IÂ´ve long had a dream about making a blog about my professional interests and now that I have only 30 study points left
to acquire and finish my bachelor's thesis
