Let's begin.

The first post is going to be about the configuration of my site, www.xpyx.fi.

The webhosting is from [Suomen Hostingpalvelu Oy](https://www.hostingpalvelu.fi/) and I used
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to build it. I use [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to author my posts.

I have had a dream about creating a blog about my professional interests and now that I have only 30 study points left
to acquire and finish my bachelor's thesis I feel that the time is right to start a diary of some sort.

I chose to write in English, because one of the points of this blog is to help people understand techniques to create
something. I have had so much help for my productions and projects from blogs of other people, so it's time to start
giving back to the community.

I'm not anywhere near a professional, but I have a LOT of enthusiasm and motivation for being able to build systems that
enable people to create art and make people's lives easier. What I want to achieve in my upcoming professional career is
to help earth survive humans that are actively trying to destroy the planet.

I study in Metropolia University of Applied Sciences and I'm majoring in Mobile Application Developement.
