Let's begin.

The first post is going to be about the motivation and purpose of my site, www.xpyx.fi.

The webhosting is from [Suomen Hostingpalvelu Oy](https://www.hostingpalvelu.fi/) and I used
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to build it. I use [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to author my posts.
I followed instructions from [Jonathan McGlone's](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) absolutely superb post.

Never used Jekyll before, but it took me only a little over 30 mins to get everything up and running.

I will be using this site to host a plethora of links to subjects that interest me. I will try to do a blog post at
least once a week.

"Why all the trouble?", you might ask.

I have had a dream about creating a blog about my professional interests and now that I have only 30 study points left
to acquire and finish my bachelor's thesis I feel that the time is right to start a diary of some sort.

I chose to write in English, because one of the reasons behind this blog is to help as many people as possible to
understand different techniques to create something. I have had so much help for my productions and projects from blogs
of other people, so it's time to start giving back to the community.

I'm not anywhere near a professional developer, yet, but I have a LOT of enthusiasm and motivation for being able to
build systems that enable people to create art and make people's lives easier. What I want to achieve in my upcoming
professional career is to help earth survive humans that are actively trying to destroy the planet.

I study in Metropolia University of Applied Sciences and I'm majoring in Mobile Application Developement. My strong
background in music enables me to combine developing and music production.

So the next blog post will be about a project where I investigate the possibilities of using neural nets for generating
audio. I got a grant for this project from [Taike](https://www.taike.fi/) and I will be using this blog to keep a record
of my experiences in the domain of [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) and
[creative computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_computing).

Welcome aboard!
