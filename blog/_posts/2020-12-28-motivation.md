Let's begin.

The very first post is about the purpose of my site [xpyx.fi](https://www.xpyx.fi/) and the motivation behind it.

My web hosting provider is [Suomen Hostingpalvelu Oy](https://www.hostingpalvelu.fi/) and I used
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to build the site with instructions from
[Jonathan McGlone's](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) absolutely superb guide.

I never used Jekyll before, but it took me only a bit over 30 mins to get everything up and running.

I will be using this site to host a plethora of links to subjects that interest me. I will try to come up with a
blog post at least once a week.

"Why all the trouble", you might ask.

I have had a dream about creating a blog about my professional interests and now that I am only 30 study points and
a thesis short of a bachelor's degree, I feel that the time is right to start a diary of some sort.

I chose to write in English because one of the reasons behind this blog is to help as many people as possible to
understand different techniques to create something. So it's natural to write in English because my native language,
Finnish, is spoken only in Finland and by a bit over five million people. I feel that I have had so much help for my
endeavours from blogs of other people, so it's time to start giving back to the community.

I'm not anywhere near a professional developer, yet, but I have a LOT of enthusiasm and motivation for being able to
build systems that enable people to make people's lives easier, and to create art. What I want to achieve in my upcoming
professional career is to help earth survive humans who are actively trying to destroy the planet. I realised this only
after the birth of my first child.

I study in Metropolia University of Applied Sciences and I'm majoring in Mobile Application Developement. My strong
background in music enables me to combine developing and music production.

So the next blog post will be about a project where I investigate the possibilities of using neural nets for generating
audio. I got a grant for this project from [Taike](https://www.taike.fi/) and I will be using this blog to keep a record
of my experiences in the domain of [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) and
[creative computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_computing).

Welcome aboard!
